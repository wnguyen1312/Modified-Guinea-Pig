Description of GUINEA-PIG Output Files

1) photon.dat:
   
   It contains the photons after the interaction.

   Photon Energy [GeV] |  angle x [rad] |  angle y [rad] 

   If the energy is negative the photon is from the second beam.	

2) beam1(2).dat
   
   Particles of the first and second beam respectively.

   Particle Energy [GeV] | x [um] | y [um] | z [um] | x' [urad] | y' [urad]

3) coh1(2).dat 
   
   Coherent Pairs of the first and second beam respectively.
   
   Particle Energy [GeV] | x [um] | y [um] | z [um] | x' [mrad] | y' [mrad]

4) pairs.dat 
  
   Incoherent Pairs after beam-beam interaction.
   
   Particle Energy [GeV] | Beta_x | Beta_y | Beta_z | x [nm] | y [nm] | z [nm] | process (*)

   (*) 'process' can be:
       	'0' : Breit-Wheeler
	'1' : Bethe-Heitler
	'2' : Landau-Lifschitz

5) hadron.dat

   Colliding photons that produced a hadronic event. 
   Since the number of these events is small per bunch crossing the number
   will be enhanced by a factor hadron_ratio.
  
   Photon Energy beam1 [GeV] | Photon Energy beam2 [GeV] | z of collision [um]

6) lumi.ee.out

   Colliding particles infos. do_lumi=1 e-e collision.
   energy of the colliding particles 
   position of the collision within the bunch 
   value of "time counter" of the collision
   normalized velocities of the colliding particles
   polarization vector of colliding particles (px1(2),py1(2),pz1(2))
   label 

   Energy beam1 [GeV] | Energy beam2 [GeV] | x [nm] | y [nm] | z [um] | Px1/E1 | Py1/E1 | Px2/E2 | Py2/E2 | px1 | py1 | pz1 | px2 | py2 | pz2 | label
